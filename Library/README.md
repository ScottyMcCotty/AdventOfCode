# Things to add
## Here's a list of custom classes we might want to implement

* 2D grid, probably storing integers
    + desired member functions:
        - rotating, mirroring
        - swapping columns / rows
        - setters & getters
        - constructor works with raw input data
    + square grid can inherit from 2D grid
* Circular linked list
    + desired member functions:
        - iterating
        - adding / removing elements
        - getting / moving slices of elements
* Game of Life
    + desired member functions:
        - constructor gets told when to kill cells, when to grow cells, etc
        - get board after X generations
        - work backwards from given board? hard
